 <h1>Java If ... Else</h1>


**Java Conditions and If Statements**

 - You already know that Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

 - Less than: a < b
 - Less than or equal to: a <= b
 - Greater than: a > b
 - Greater than or equal to: a >= b
 - Equal to a == b
 - Not Equal to: a != b
 - You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

 - Java has the following conditional statements:

 - Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
 - Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
 - Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
 - Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

**if statement**
 - Use the if statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true.
 
**syntax**

 -  if (condition) {
  
 - }

 - The code structure of an if statement is as follows:

**The else Statement:**

   - Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
**syntax**

   - if (condition) {
   - } else {
   - }
  
   - The code structure of an else statement is as follows: 
   
**The else if Statement:**

   - Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
**syntax**

   - if (condition1) {
   - } else if (condition2) {
   - } else {
   - }
   - The code structure of an else if statement is as follows:
   
**Short Hand If...Else:**

   - There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands.

   - It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line, and is most often used to replace simple if else statements.
  
 **syntax**
 
   - variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue :  expressionFalse;
   -  The code structure of an hand if is as follows:

<h1>Challenges faced</h1>

- While writing if else conditions we need to evaluate data for evrery condition such as for greater than condition lessa than conditions and equal to conditions.
