What is Java?

Java is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in the mid-1990s. It is a class-based, object-oriented language that is designed to be portable and run on any platform, allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere. Java is widely used for developing desktop applications, mobile apps, and web-based applications, as well as for building server-side applications and games.

why java?

Platform Independent: Java code can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine, which eliminates the need for recompilation.

Object-Oriented: Java supports object-oriented programming, which allows for the creation of modular and reusable code.

Robust: Java has strong memory management and automatic exception handling, making it more reliable and less prone to crashes.

Secure: Java is designed to be secure, with built-in security features such as type-safe objects and automatic memory management.

Large Community: Java has a large, active developer community that provides ongoing support, development, and improvement to the language.

Versatile: Java can be used for a variety of applications, including web, mobile, desktop, and enterprise applications.

Scalable: Java can handle high-volume, high-performance applications by using multiple threads to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

Variables in java:

In Java, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value of a specific data type. There are several types of variables in Java, including:

Primitive Variables: These are the basic data types in Java, such as int, float, double, char, and boolean.

Reference Variables: These are variables that refer to objects, and include arrays and class objects.

Local Variables: These are variables declared within a method or block, and are only accessible within that scope.

Instance Variables: These are variables that belong to an object, and are accessible from any method within the object's class.
