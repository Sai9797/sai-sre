What is Java?

Java is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in the mid-1990s. It is a class-based, object-oriented language that is designed to be portable and run on any platform, allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere. Java is widely used for developing desktop applications, mobile apps, and web-based applications, as well as for building server-side applications and games.

why java?

Platform Independent: Java code can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine, which eliminates the need for recompilation.

Object-Oriented: Java supports object-oriented programming, which allows for the creation of modular and reusable code.

Robust: Java has strong memory management and automatic exception handling, making it more reliable and less prone to crashes.

Secure: Java is designed to be secure, with built-in security features such as type-safe objects and automatic memory management.

Large Community: Java has a large, active developer community that provides ongoing support, development, and improvement to the language.

Versatile: Java can be used for a variety of applications, including web, mobile, desktop, and enterprise applications.

Scalable: Java can handle high-volume, high-performance applications by using multiple threads to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

Variables in java:

In Java, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value of a specific data type. There are several types of variables in Java, including:
In java, a variable is a location in memory to store a value, where a value can be of any data type such as an integer,float,string,etc.


  int age = 24;
  float salary = 65000.0f;
  string name = "John Doe";
 

Primitive Variables: These are the basic data types in Java, such as int, float, double, char, and boolean.

Reference Variables: These are variables that refer to objects, and include arrays and class objects.

Local Variables: These are variables declared within a method or block, and are only accessible within that scope.

Instance Variables: These are variables that belong to an object, and are accessible from any method within the object's class.

Static Variables: In Java, a variable is a location in memory to store a value, where a value can be of any data type such as an integer, float, string, etc.

Here are some examples of declaring variables in Java:
  int age = 24;
  float salary = 65000.0f;
  String name = "John Doe";
1) Conditional statements in Java are used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. The two main types of conditional statements are if and switch.

  if statement:
The basic structure of an if statement is as follows:

  if (condition) {
   // code to be executed if the condition is true
  }
For example:


  int x = 10;

  if (x > 5) {
   System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
  }
In this example, the if statement checks if the value of x is greater than 5. If it is, then the code inside the braces is executed and the output will be x is greater than 5.

if-else statement:
The if-else statement is an extension of the if statement, and it allows you to specify a separate block of code to be executed if the condition is false:

  if (condition) {
   // code to be executed if the condition is true
  } else {
   // code to be executed if the condition is false
  }
For example:


  int x = 10;

  if (x > 5) {
   System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
  } else {
   System.out.println("x is not greater than 5");
  }
In this example, the if statement checks if the value of x is greater than 5. If it is, the code inside the first set of braces is executed, and the output will be x is greater than 5. If it's not, then the code inside the second set of braces is executed, and the output will be x is not greater than 5.

switch statement:
The switch statement is used to choose from a number of possible options based on the value of an expression.

  switch (expression) {
   case value1:
      // code to be executed if the expression is equal to value1
      break;
   case value2:
      // code to be executed if the expression is equal to value2
      break;
   ...
   default:
      // code to be executed if none of the cases match the expression
  }
For example:

  int day = 4;

  switch (day) {
   case 1:
      System.out.println("Monday");
      break;
   case 2:
      System.out.println("Tuesday");
      break;
   case 3:
      System.out.println("Wednesday");
      break;
   cas
      System.out.println("Thursday");
      break;
   case 5:
      System.out.println("Friday");
      break;
   default:
      System.out.println("Weekend");
  }
In this example, the expression in the switch statement is the value of day, which is 4. The code inside the case that matches the value of day (in this case, case 4) will be executed, and the output will be Thursday.

2) Data Types in java:
In Java, there are several built-in data types, including:

Primitive data types:

byte: a signed 8-bit integer type, with a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127.
short: a signed 16-bit integer type, with a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767.
int: a signed 32-bit integer type, with a minimum value of -2,147,483,648 and a maximum value of 2,147,483,647.
long: a signed 64-bit integer type, with a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
float: a single-precision 32-bit floating-point type, which is useful for representing fractional values.
double: a double-precision 64-bit floating-point type, which is useful for representing very large or small fractional values.
char: a 16-bit unsigned Unicode character type, with a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).
boolean: a type that can have only two possible values: true or false.
Non-primitive data types (also known as reference types):

String: a sequence of characters.
Arrays: a collection of homogeneous elements.
Classes: a blueprint to create objects, a template for objects.
Interfaces: a blueprint of method signatures that need to be implemented.
Enumerations: a fixed number of named values.
It's important to note that the size and range of these data types may vary between different platforms. However, in Java, these sizes and ranges are guaranteed to be consistent across all platforms.
