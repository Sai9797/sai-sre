 <h1>java math</h1>

- The Java Math class has many methods that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.


**Math.max(x,y)**

 - The Math.max(x,y) method can be used to find the highest value of x and y.
 
 - Math.max(5, 10);
 
**Math.min(x,y)**;


   - The Math.min(x,y) method can be used to find the lowest value of x and y.
   
   - Math.min(5, 10);  
   
**Math.sqrt(x):**

   - The Math.sqrt(x) method returns the square root of x.
   
   - Math.sqrt(64);
   
**Math.abs(x):**

   - The Math.abs(x) method returns the absolute (positive) value of x.
   
   - Math.abs(-4.7);
   
 **Random Numbers:**
 
   - Math.random() returns a random number between 0.0 (inclusive), and 1.0 (exclusive).
   
   - Math.random();
   
  
 <h1>Java Booleans:<h1/>
 
 
  - Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:

  - YES / NO
  - ON / OFF
  - TRUE / FALSE
  - For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can store true or false values.
 
  
 **Boolean value:**
 
  
  - A boolean type is declared with the boolean keyword and can only take the values true or false.
  - The code structure of an boolean value is as follows: https://github.com/Sai9797/sai-sre/blob/my_branch/boolean-values.java
 
  
 **Boolean Expression:**
 
  
  - A Boolean expression returns a boolean value: true or false.
  - The code structure of an boolean expression is as follows: https://github.com/Sai9797/sai-sre/blob/my_branch/boolean-expression.java
  
  - example:

<h1>How did I learn?</h1>

  - https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial
  -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)

<h1>Challenges faced</h1>

- faces issues in assigning math values to local global variables.
- To resolve this implemented methods and used var let and const keywords in methods and tried the usage of this variables 
- booleans values which values i have learnt by using if statement easily.
